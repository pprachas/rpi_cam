# Camera Control with Raspberry pi
This repository contains code that is able to control an Arducam camera with the Raspberry Pi as well as GPIO output signals on start the Instron and camera at the same time. The Raspberry Pi can be thought as its own small computer with a Linux based OS. One of the methods to access the Raspberry Pi itself after setup is through ssh. Note that the code in the raspberry pi can be committed to this repository.
